# Adjust "signalValue" (region treatment reads; column 7) by region control reads
# signalValue = log2((region treatment reads+1)/(region control reads+1))
# Use this signalValue with caution - unknown whether these read counts are
# normalised by library size by PeakRanger
# Preferrable to use qValue (FDR) or pValue in downstream analyses,
# including IDR calculation

# -log10 transform p-values and q-values

# Usage:
# ./4_narrowPeak_sigVal_log2TreadsNormCreads_minuslog10PQ.R HTA7_ChIP_SRR5298546
